# Real-Time Stock Price Prediction Filter

## Overview
This project demonstrates how Linear Predictive Coding (LPC) can be applied in real-time to predict stock price movements. The system simulates stock price data and allows dynamic control of LPC parameters via a user-friendly GUI.

## Features
- Real-time stock price simulation using Brownian motion.
- Predictive modeling with LPC filtering.
- Dynamic GUI with sliders to control:
  - LPC Order
  - Window Size
  - Decay Factor
- Predictive success rate and performance metrics displayed in real time.
- Data export functionality for further analysis in Excel.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Required dependencies (install via `requirements.txt`):

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
 ```bash
 git clone https://github.com/your-username/real-time-stock-prediction-filter.git
